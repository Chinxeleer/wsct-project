The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a neuropsychological test used to assess a person’s cognitive
flexibility, specifically their ability to adapt to changing rules or task demands. In the base version of the test,
participants are shown four cards with some shapes that have discernable characteristics. These character-
istics are the colour of the shapes, the type of shape and the quantity of shapes. Participants are then asked
to match new cards drawn from the deck to these examples cards, but are not told the sorting rule (e.g.,
by colour, shape, or number). They must figure it out based on feedback (correct/incorrect). After a series
of correct matches, the sorting rule changes without warning, and the participant must adapt to the new
rule. Performance is measured in terms of the number of correct matches, perseverative errors (repeating an
old rule), and how well the participant shifts strategies. This test is used to provide insight into executive
function and cognitive control, for example how well people are able to suppress their previously learning
one they realise it is no longer relevant. This is highly related to how people direct their attention and use
their working memory.
